Code Conventions
================
Go `back <../README.rst>`_ to the table of content.

I - the template's author - follow most of the PEP8 recommendations. But

which are hence not enforced in the linter's configuration (see `.pylintrc`).

In particular, the following conventions are disables by default:

:bad-whitespace:
:len-as-condition:
:no-name-in-module:
