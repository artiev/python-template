Frequently asked questions
==========================

**How can I install the app?**

You need a running python 3.7+ version on your system. And we recommend PIP
to install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. If these
dependencies are matched, and make is present on your system, you can simply
call:

.. code-block:: shell

    > make install

**What is your favorite python IDE?**

I find PyCharm to be feature rich, and it let's me refactor my code in a breeze.
Plus its code validation, auto-complete and auto-documentation feature are
very responsive. On the downside, PyCharm will eat up your battery in no time.
