Developer's Documentation
=========================

So you're building your app? Then it's time to document it. I've built up a
`starter kit` for your documentation with the kind of stuff you should tackle
early on. This section is more oriented toward collaboration, developer's
documentation, or internal documentation in general, and will often not be
published alongside the quick-start guides and user documentation.

.. warning::

    This template automatically triggers a travis build and a documentation
    build whenever the code is push to GitHub. Be careful not to expose
    intellectual property or secret recipes on
    https://readthedocs.io
