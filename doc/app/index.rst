Quickstart Guide
================

The quick-start guide should be a one-pager document which is where I should
find the absolute minimum information about the app, what its purpose is, how I
can install it and how to use it. It's oriented toward a user, not a developer.

Overall Project Architecture
============================

So you're building your app? Then it's time to document it. I've built up a
`starter kit` for your documentation with the kind of stuff you should tackle
early on. This section is more oriented toward collaboration, developer's
documentation, or internal documentation in general.
