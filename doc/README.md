Python Template Project
=======================

All you need to kick-start a python project should be here, as the template
includes code snippes, configuration files and makefile to spend more time on
your application and less on the setting up the environment.

Here is some more documentation about the template if the code is not enough:

- [Tools](tools/README.md)
- [Conventions](conventions/README.md)
