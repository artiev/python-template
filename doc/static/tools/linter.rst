Linter & Code Quality
=====================

The linting process checks all *imported* code from a given starting point
(entry file) for common PEP8 rules (not all, see conventions). In the
current configuration, the linting process also applies grammar check to all
comments on top of the normal code.

For more info on linting in python, see
https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html.
