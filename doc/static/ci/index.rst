Continuous Integration
======================

For any project where quality and maintainability is an important goal,
continuous integration is the ultimate quality gate. The stronger the rules and
the better the tests, the more stable your project will be throughout its entire
development cycle. This chapter deals mostly with configuration of these quality
gates using https://travis.io and https://codecov.io platforms. Other chapters
offer discussions about the reasons for all these configurations.
