Documenting your project with Sphinx and reStructuredText
=========================================================

This project is mixing static and dynamic documentation using the `sphinx`
module to generate html documentation. The project is also configured to trigger
a complete build of the HTML documentation on https://readthedocs.io after every
successful merge into the `master` branch.
